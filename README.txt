1. The documents found in folder "QUADRA_based_on_hardware_v2.0_with_medical_if" describes the device 
modified for medical standards, and its hardware main board is based on our v2.0 QUADRA hardware.
Current documents describe only the external interfaces.
2. The documents found in folder "QUADRA_based_on_hardware_v3.0" describes the newer hardware
version device v3.0, where "Architecture_Overview_hw_v3.0_v1.0.doc" describes the device more in-depth
- all external interfaces and all the hardware and software components. Most of the DSP internal 
algorithms and components described in this document are similar used in hardware board v2.0.
